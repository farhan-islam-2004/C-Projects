## 2. Higher Secondary Grade System

A **C program** designed to simulate a higher secondary student grading system.  

**Features:**  
- Accepts student details: Name, Registration Number, Roll No, School Name  
- Allows selection of stream and subjects  
- Generates random marks for each subject  
- Ignores the lowest mark if 6 subjects are entered (best 5 considered)  
- Calculates total, percentage, and assigns grades per subject and overall  

## 3. Number Guessing Game

A fun console-based game where the user guesses a randomly generated number.  

**Features:**  
- Generates a random number between 1–100  
- Tracks number of guesses  
- Provides hints if the guess is too high or too low  
- Congratulates the user when they guess correctly


## 4. Tower of Hanoi

A recursive solution to the classic **Tower of Hanoi puzzle**.  

**Features:**  
- User inputs the number of disks  
- Prints step-by-step moves to transfer all disks from source to destination using an auxiliary rod  
- Demonstrates the power of recursion in problem-solving
